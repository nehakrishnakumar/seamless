The scope of this application is the numerical integration of arbitrary functions 
to solve the Rosetta Code numerical integration task\cite{rosetta-code-numerical-integration}
in Chapel. Solving the task requires development of functions to calculate the definite 
integral of a function ($f(x)$) using rectangular (left, right, and midpoint), trapezium, and Simpson's methods.
